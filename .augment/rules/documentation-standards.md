├── security/
│   ├── threat-model.md
│   ├── security-architecture.md
│   ├── compliance-requirements.md
│   └── incident-response-plan.md
├── development/
│   ├── setup-guide.md
│   ├── coding-standards.md
│   ├── testing-strategy.md
│   └── deployment-procedures.md
└── user/
    ├── user-guide.md

   - Cost monitoring and optimization strategies

### Security Documentation Standards

**MANDATORY security documentation:**

1. **Threat Modeling Documentation**
   - Asset identification and classification
   - Threat actor profiles and attack vectors
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Security control implementation details

2. **Compliance Documentation**
   - Regulatory requirements mapping (PCI-DSS, GDPR, etc.)
   - Audit trail and logging specifications
   - Data retention and deletion policies
   - Privacy impact assessments

3. **Incident Response Documentation**
   - Escalation procedures and contact information
   - Forensic analysis and evidence collection
   - Communication templates and notification procedures
   - Post-incident review and improvement processes

### Quality Assurance Documentation

**Testing and QA documentation requirements:**

1. **Test Strategy Documentation**
   - Test pyramid and coverage requirements
   - Automated testing frameworks and tools
   - Performance testing scenarios and benchmarks
   - Security testing procedures and tools

2. **Quality Metrics and KPIs**
   - Code quality standards and metrics
   - Performance benchmarks and SLAs
   - User experience metrics and success criteria
   - Business value measurements and ROI tracking

### Development Workflow Documentation

**Process documentation for team coordination:**

1. **Development Lifecycle Documentation**
   - Git workflow and branching strategies
   - Code review procedures and checklists
   - Continuous integration and deployment pipelines
   - Release management and versioning procedures

2. **Archon Integration Documentation**
   - Task management workflows and procedures
   - Knowledge base organization and maintenance
   - Project tracking and progress reporting
   - Research and documentation standards

### Documentation Maintenance Standards

**Keeping documentation current and useful:**

1. **Version Control and Updates**
   - Documentation versioning aligned with code releases
   - Regular review and update schedules
   - Change tracking and approval processes
   - Automated documentation generation where possible

2. **Accessibility and Discoverability**
   - Clear navigation and search capabilities
   - Consistent formatting and style guidelines
   - Multi-format support (markdown, PDF, web)
   - Integration with development tools and IDEs

### Documentation Quality Checklist

**Before considering documentation complete:**

- [ ] **Completeness**: All required sections present and detailed
- [ ] **Accuracy**: Information verified and up-to-date
- [ ] **Clarity**: Written for target audience with appropriate technical level
- [ ] **Consistency**: Follows established style and formatting guidelines
- [ ] **Actionability**: Provides clear steps and procedures
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Easy to update and keep current
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Available to all team members and stakeholders
- [ ] **Integration**: Links to related documentation and resources

### Documentation Review Process

**MANDATORY review process for all documentation:**

1. **Technical Review**
   - Accuracy of technical details and specifications
   - Completeness of implementation guidance
   - Alignment with architectural decisions
   - Security and compliance considerations

2. **Editorial Review**
   - Grammar, spelling, and style consistency
   - Clarity and readability for target audience
   - Logical organization and flow
   - Proper formatting and visual presentation

3. **Stakeholder Review**
   - Business requirements alignment

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - Documentation coverage of codebase
   - Freshness and update frequency
   - Accuracy and error rates
   - Time to find information (discoverability)

## Implementation Guidelines

**Documentation-driven development approach:**

1. **Design Phase**: Create architectural and API documentation
2. **Development Phase**: Maintain code comments and inline documentation
3. **Testing Phase**: Document test procedures and results
4. **Deployment Phase**: Update operational and user documentation
5. **Maintenance Phase**: Regular review and update cycles

**QUALITY GATE:**
No feature or system component should be considered complete without corresponding documentation that meets these standards.
