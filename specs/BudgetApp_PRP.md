# Product Requirements Plan (PRP)  
**Project:** AI-Powered Household Budget App  
**Author:** Chris  
**Date:** 2025-08-17  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This PRP outlines the phased development, dependencies, risks, and milestones for building the AI-powered household budgeting app. The app enables users to manage budgets, track bills, analyze spending, and receive AI-driven financial suggestions.  

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- Provide a cross-platform budgeting app (desktop first, mobile later).  
- Integrate AI agents to generate savings tips, spending analysis, and forecasting.  
- Support multiple data ingestion formats (CSV, Excel, PDF).  
- Create a secure, user-friendly, and scalable application.  

---

## 3. Scope

### In-Scope
- Core budgeting and bill tracking  
- Bank statement ingestion via file uploads (CSV/XLSX/PDF)  
- AI financial assistant with suggestions and reminders  
- Cross-platform compatibility (Flutter UI, Python backend, SQLite for MVP)  
- Reports (monthly summaries, bill calendar, savings opportunities)  

### Out-of-Scope (Future Versions)
- Direct API integrations with banks  
- Automated payments  
- Investment portfolio tracking  
- Multi-user collaboration  

---

## 4. Target Users
- **Primary:** Individuals managing household budgets manually or via spreadsheets.  
- **Secondary:** Small families or couples wanting shared financial tracking.

## 6. Milestones

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1–2)**  
- Project scaffold (Flutter + FastAPI)  
- Database models (SQLite)  
- Health & settings API  
- Basic import pipeline (CSV/XLSX)  

**Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3–5)**  
- Transactions table + rules engine  
- Categories & budgets  
- Bill detection + reminders  
- Export/backup functionality  

**Phase 3: AI Integration (Week 6–8)**
- AI categorizer (rules → model fallback)
- “What Changed?” anomaly explanations
- Savings tips (subscription creep detection)
- CrewAI Master Agent system implementation
- Natural language interface development
- Multi-agent orchestration setup

**Phase 4: Advanced AI Features (Week 9–10)**
- Voice integration (speech-to-text/text-to-speech)
- Conversational AI chat interface
- Contextual suggestions and proactive notifications
- AI-assisted data import and parsing

**Phase 5: Polish & Release (Week 11–12)**
- UI/UX polish (Material 3 dark theme)
- Keyboard shortcuts + accessibility review
- Performance optimizations
- AI response quality testing and validation
- Final testing & packaging

---

## 7. Dependencies
- **Frontend:** Flutter, Riverpod, dio, intl, speech_to_text, flutter_tts
- **Backend:** FastAPI, SQLModel, Alembic, Pandas, scikit-learn, pdfplumber, pytesseract (OCR), ofxparse, qifparse
- **AI/LLM:** CrewAI, OpenAI API, LangChain, SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, Ollama (optional local LLM)
- **Database:** SQLite (MVP), optional SQLCipher for encryption

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Poor OCR accuracy on PDFs → **Mitigation:** Use multiple libraries (pytesseract + pdfplumber) and allow manual corrections.  
- **Risk:** AI misclassification → **Mitigation:** Rules precedence, user correction retrains model.
- **Risk:** Performance bottlenecks on large imports → **Mitigation:** Optimize parsing with Pandas + indexing.
- **Risk:** LLM API costs and rate limits → **Mitigation:** Implement local LLM fallback, optimize prompt efficiency, user usage monitoring.
- **Risk:** AI response accuracy and hallucinations → **Mitigation:** Implement response validation, confidence scoring, user feedback loops.
- **Risk:** Scope creep → **Mitigation:** Strict phase planning, defer non-MVP features.

---

## 9. Acceptance Criteria
- Import mixed files (CSV/XLSX/PDF text) successfully with preview & mapping wizard.  
- At least 2 recurring bills auto-detected and tracked.
- Categorizer achieves ≥80% accuracy after user trains with 50+ labels.
- Monthly “What Changed?” summary generated in <2 seconds (excluding OCR).
- AI Master Agent responds to natural language queries within 5 seconds.
- Voice input/output processing completes within 3 seconds.
- CrewAI agents provide contextually relevant responses with >90% user satisfaction.
- Full export + re-import produces consistent aggregates.

---

## 10. Future Roadmap
- Android port via Flutter.  
- Direct bank API integrations (legal permitting).  
- Cloud sync with encrypted storage.  
- Multi-user household budgets with role-based access.
